A bittorrent host, tracker and 3 client setup. A bit messy as it was my first scenario, so needs to be cleaned up a bit.

There aren't any scenarios, per se, but the network traffic that is captured can be altered based on what files are in what folders. The torrent-start.sh script takes any files in the /downloads folder, creates a .torrent file for them, moves the .torrent files to the /share/torrents folder before all torrent files are downloaded/seeded by the three clients and the host containers. Therefore, the data that is tranferred can either be entirely contained within the subnetwork by putting random files into /downloads. Alternatively, the network traffic can come from outside of the network by simply putting a .torrent file into the /share/torrents folder that has been sourced from some public tracker.

Usage of the script: torrent-start.sh [DURATION] [REPEAT]

Make the duration reasonably long, as it takes a while for everything to be setup.
